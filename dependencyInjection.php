/*
We created a dependency, called Database. The Database dependency currently can only do one thing, which is connecting to a database.
We created a User class. This class can only do on thing, which is getting user data. In order to do this, the User class needs the Database dependency to connect to the database.
We created a User object, and passed a Database object (the dependency) to its constructor. By doing so, weâ€™re injecting the Database dependency into the User object.
