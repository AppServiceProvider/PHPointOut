### Virtual function  best describe the concept of polymorphism 
polymorphism is through the use of virtual functions. Virtual functions enable a derived class to provide a specific implementation of a function that is already declared in its base class


###  How many types of polymorphism in the php programming language?
* there are primarily two types of polymorphism

- Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism): 
    Method Overloading
    `two or more methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters`


- Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism): 
    Method Overloading,
    `a child class provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its parent class. This is achieved using the parent keyword and the override annotation (optional) in PHP`

    Interfaces and Abstract Classes: 
    `polymorphism through interfaces and abstract classes. Multiple classes can implement the same interface or extend the same abstract class, providing a common set of methods.`
