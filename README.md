cURL (Client URL) is a powerful library in PHP 
that allows you to make HTTP requests and interact with APIs, websites, and other services. 
It enables you to send and receive data over various protocols, 
such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and others.






cURL Works:
1 Initialize a cURL session using curl_init().
2 Set options for the cURL session using curl_setopt(), such as the URL, request method (GET, POST), headers, and data.
3 Execute the request using curl_exec(), which sends the request and returns the response.
4 Close the cURL session using curl_close() to free up resources.
